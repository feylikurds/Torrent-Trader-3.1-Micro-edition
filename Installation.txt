TORRENTTRADER V3.0 MICRO EDITION INSTALL NOTES (LAST MODIFIED 13 February 2021 by MicroMonkey)
===================================================================

READ FIRST:
===========
THIS SCRIPT IS PROVIDED AS-IS.

- These notes are designed for fresh install only. Below is a checklist of things that you will need
to have before this script will work.

1) *removed

Enter API keys in backend/config near the top. The info below is for reference only. You dont need to edit those files.

account-login.php for google captcha is on line 12 & 13 (sign up here https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/)
(no longer working unles you have a jwplayer 7 key) jw-view-cinema.php for the site videos on line 43 (sign up for your key https://www.jwplayer.com/).

2) This code was tested and modded on ubuntu 20.04.2 server. I wouldn't expect it to function properly under windows server, and
I offer NO help with that. Be smart.....use LINUX.

3) openSSL is required for torrent downloads to work, unless you reverse the edits, which are clearly marked
in the torrents-details.php (start line 132) and backend/functions.php (start line 1266). Install openSSL on your linux server. Its easy, just do it.
The .htaccess file is already in place for everything to work, but you will need to ensure that your apache can use .htaccess.
This is set in your apache2 configuration.

4) OPTIONAL - Go to http://www.projecthoneypot.org/ and sign up (its free). Get your file from them and insert it into the honeypot folder.
This will help prevent spam harvesters from raiding your site for emails and the like. Just an extra measure of security and you should participate if you are able or just remove the code.

5) This script will NOT work properly as is under PHP 8. Tested and working on PHP 7.4

6) *removed for php 7 update

7) To have IMDB info added to your files, you need to get an API key from omdb (https://www.omdbapi.com/)
 and place the key in backend/TTIMDB line 3. You will see where it goes. They currently as of this writing have free keys, just dont abuse it.

8) You can choose between the regular shoutbox or the Ajshout in the config file as well. Both shoutboxes are independent of each other,
 so anything done in one will not show up in the other.

8.1) (credit UFFENO1 and Tiloup) Added IP checking to the config and account-signup.php. Only 1 account per IP address. This can be changed in config.php

8.2) Language updates (7-22-2018)

9) I added the new forum modifications by UFFENO1 and tiloup (7-7-2018), so if you add any other themes, you need to add this to the theme.css at the bottom for
 each theme.

   }
